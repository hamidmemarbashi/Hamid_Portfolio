## [Project 1 - HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance](https://github.com/hamidmemarbashi/Employee_Attrition/blob/main/Employee_Attrition.ipynb)

The director of human resources is interested in knowing the factors that lead to employee attrition and he wants to see which variables are contributing the most in attrition. His main question is:

**“Do employees with lower income tend to leave?”**

- Young/new employees have the higher attrition rate. Most of them are interns or contractors. Company could have a solid plan to absorb the talented interns as their future assets.
- Those employees, who work at the department of Research and Development with background of Life Sciences have the higher attrition rate.
- Income plays a big role in attrition rate. Those employees with lower income tend to leave the company.
- Those employees with high job involvement have the higher attrition rate. The company should come up with a solution to lower the pressure and keep these valuable employees.

## [Project 2 - Bike Share Analysis](https://github.com/hamidmemarbashi/Bike_Share_Analysis/blob/main/Bike_Share_Analysis.ipynb)

The Cyclistic is a fiction bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, we want to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. Then, the goal is to design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.

**"How we can convert casual riders into anual members?"**

- Nearly **77%** of the customers are **Subscribed** users and **23%** of them are guest. The goal is to reduce the number of guest customers and turn them to subscribers.
- Nearly **63%** of customers are male, **22%** are female and **15%** of them didn't specify their gender.
- Most of the subscribed riders use the service for their daily commute and their rides only take less than 30 minutes.
- We could have a better analysis if we knew, where the guest customers are from. By knowing that, we could say confidently that this group of riders are tourists and the other group of riders are local. So, we could focus on the local casual riders and encourage them to subscribe by providing loyalty cards, promotions and etc.

## [Project 3 - House Price Prediction](https://github.com/hamidmemarbashi/USA_Housing/blob/main/USA_Housing.ipynb)

As the house price is a Continuous Variable, in this project we are going to design a linear regression model to predict the house price. 

**"Can we predict the house price in the US market?"**

- One unit increase in the Avg. Area Income, is associated with an increase of around $232680 in price.
- One unit increase in the Avg. Area House Age, is associated with an increase of around $163841 in price.
- One unit increase in the Avg. Area Number of Rooms, is associated with an increase of around $121110 in price.
- One unit increase in the Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms, is associated with an increase of around $2893 in price.
- One unit increase in the Area Population, is associated with an increase of around $151252 in price.
