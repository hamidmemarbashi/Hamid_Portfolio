## [Project 1 - HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance] (https://github.com/hamidmemarbashi/Employee_Attrition/blob/main/Employee_Attrition.ipynb)

The director of human resources is interested in knowing the factors that lead to employee attrition and he wants to see which variables are contributing the most in attrition. His main question is:

#### “Do employees with lower income tend to leave?”

- Young/new employees have the higher attrition rate. Most of them are interns or contractors. Company could have a solid plan to absorb the talented interns as their future assets.
- Those employees, who work at the department of Research and Development with background of Life Sciences have the higher attrition rate.
- Income plays a big role in attrition rate. Those employees with lower income tend to leave the company.
- Those employees with high job involvement have the higher attrition rate. The company should come up with a solution to lower the pressure and keep these valuable employees.
